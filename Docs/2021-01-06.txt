Practised all basic commands and have experimented with them and
with some new commands forms and using it in different way to explore.

- Renaming the branch using git push and by deleting the old name
-Renaming the repo.

-  For creating a new connection to a remote repo and give it a name
to be used as shortcut for a url

- Fetch a branch from remote repo
$git fetch [remote-repo] [Branch]
eg:- $git fetch origin Docs

- Fetch the specified repo and merge it with local copy
$git pull [remote-repo]
eg:- $git pull Cybercom

- Pushing a branch we have created to a remote a repo
with all commits and objects

- Recovering the files and going back to the head , before 1 commit or 2 commit 
before head

$git reset --hard HEAD
$git reset --hard HEAD^
$git reset --hard HEAD~2

- There is also a same command for soft reset
$git reset --soft HEAD

but its work is to the changes done between 
the original HEAD and the current HEAD will be staged

The soft reset won't alter the working directory and index
